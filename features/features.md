    name: Features of machine translation APIs
---

The **features** of machine translation vary across [machine translation APIs](/apis/apis.md) and applications:

- [Language support](/languages/languages.md)
- [Customisation](/features/customisation/customisation.md)
- [Data confidentiality](/features/data-confidentiality.md)
- [Pricing](/features/pricing.md) and self-service

APIs usually offer many features not included in raw models:
- [language identification](../concepts/language-identification.md)
- segmentation
- [bridging](../applications/advanced-concepts/bridging.md) (pivoting)
- [glossary](../features/customisation/glossaries.md)
- encoding options
- HTML/XML tag handling

APIs also vary by their underlying architecture.

Some providers offer self-serve APIs - ready-to-use systems that can be integrated immediately.
Others require a conversation to train a model from scratch — or use a pre-trained model — and deploy and maintain it.
