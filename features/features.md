    name: Features of machine translation APIs
---

The **features** of machine translation vary across [machine translation APIs](/apis) and applications:

- [Language support](/languages)
- [Customisation](/customisation)
- [Data confidentiality](/data-confidentiality)
- [Pricing](/pricing) and self-service

APIs usually offer many features not included in raw models:
- [language identification](/language-identification)
- segmentation
- [bridging](/bridging) (pivoting)
- [glossary](/glossaries)
- encoding options
- HTML/XML tag handling

APIs also vary by their underlying architecture.

Some providers offer self-serve APIs - ready-to-use systems that can be integrated immediately.
Others require a conversation to train a model from scratch — or use a pre-trained model — and deploy and maintain it.
