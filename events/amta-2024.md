## Call for papers

[amtaweb.org/amta-2024-call-for-proposals/](https://amtaweb.org/amta-2024-call-for-proposals/)

At AMTA 2024, proposals are not submitted under different tracks.
Instead, there is a choice between review methods:

- A peer-review for academic paper
- A less rigorous review for other submissions


### Topics

- Latest advances in machine translation
- Using Large Language Models for translation, transcreation, and other cross-lingual use cases
- Training Data: data sources, extraction, alignment, and cleaning of corpora, terminology, data augmentation, metadata extraction, multimodal data, and more
- Adaptation and customisation of machine translation models or LLMs for cross-lingual use cases
- Augmenting machine translation with machine learning, natural language processing or generative AI
- Comparative evaluation of machine translation systems
- Machine translation for low resource languages
- Model distillation, compression, and on-device machine translation
- Machine translation in production scenarios, robustness and deployment issues.
- Machine translation for multiple modalities (speech, sign language, video, and more)
- Machine translation for real-time communication (chats, social networks, and more)
- Integration of machine translation and related cross-lingual technologies in translation and localisation pipelines
- Output quality estimation and evaluation: tools, methods, and metrics, such as human evaluations, automatic scoring, and automatic annotation of machine translation output
- Detecting and preventing catastrophic errors in output
- Measuring fairness, bias, and transparency in output
- Post-editing and human-in-the-loop methods: New approaches, successes and failures, applicability to different content-types, etc.
- The interaction of language professionals (translators and interpreters) with machine translation and generative AI tools and output
- Advanced machine translation fine-tuning and enhancement: including pre- and post-processing; controlling style, tone of voice, gender
- Interactive and real-time adaptive machine translation systems: including advanced approaches to leverage TM and end-user feedback
- Business Cases: making the business case for adopting machine translation and related cross-lingual technologies to drive business requirements
- Ethics, policy, and regulatory trends concerning the use of machine translation or generative AI for cross-lingual use cases
- Cross-language information retrieval
-  Source text improvement: improving the source content destined for machine translation through automatic tools such as grammar correction, guidelines, and NLP
