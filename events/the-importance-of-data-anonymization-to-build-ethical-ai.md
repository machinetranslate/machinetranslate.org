- 'The speaker was Manuel Herranz, CEO of <a href=''/companies#pangeanic''>Pangeanic.</a>
  <br> Data provenance and the use and inclusion of personal data have not been historically
  a consideration in the building of machine translation systems and, lately, Large
  Language Models (LLMs). Manuelâ€™s convergence lecture will touch upon concepts such
  as Ethical AI and the need to build ethics all along the data generation and data
  acquisition pipelines when building AI products and services, GDPR, compliance,
  EU anonymisation projects, the data-for-AI market, etc. He will also discuss the
  challenges involved in anonymisation of multilingual content in the context of machine
  translation. '
