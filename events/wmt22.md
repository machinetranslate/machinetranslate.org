The *News* machine translation task has been renamed the *General* machine translation task.


### General machine translation

- Multi-domain direction

> Blind tests for all languages will contain (up to) four different domains. Likely news, social, conversational, and e-commerce.

- Aggregated blind testsets across tasks

> Participants from each shared task will translate blind testsets from other shared tasks if given language pair is shared. This will allow comparisons of participants across tasks. Each shared task will evaluate their blind testsets separately.

- Rethinking human evaluation

- Removing 10 hours annotation per primary system requirement

> Instead, participants will be required to submit a system description paper if they submit the primary system.

- Pre-trained models in constrained setup allowed


#### Language pairs

Confirmed language pairs:
- Chinese-English
- Czech-English
- German-English
- German-French
- Japanese-English
- Russian-English

To be announced:
- Low-resource language pairs


## Scientific papers

### Topics:

- MT models (neural, statistical etc. )
- Analysis of neural models for MT
- Using comparable corpora for MT
- Selection and preparation of data for MT
- Semi-supervised and unsupervised learning for MT, transfer learning
- Multilingual MT
- Incorporating linguistic information into MT
- MT inference
- Manual and automatic methods for evaluating MT
- Quality estimation for MT


### Research Papers

> Research papers should describe original research corresponding to the categories listed above. Research papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted and published at WMT 2022.

> We will not accept for publication papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that have been or will be published elsewhere. It is acceptable to submit work that has been made available as a technical report (or similar, e.g. in arXiv) without citing it.

> For the research track, papers should be anonymised, be between 6 and 10 pages in length (excluding references) and may include supplementary material.


### System Papers

> System papers must describe one or more shared task submissions. System paper submissions that we cannot link to a shared task submission will be rejected without review. System papers can overlap with other published work, and do not have to follow the double submission policy. There is no maximum length for system papers, but normally a short paper (4-6 pages) is appropriate. System papers should not be anonymised.


## Poster format

Details about poster format are to be determined.


## Paper submission

- Papers must be submitted [electronically](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2022/WMT/).
- Research and system papers have the same deadlines.
- Research and system papers should follow [EMNLP2022 formatting guidelines](https://2022.emnlp.org/call-for-papers/style-and-formatting).


## Invited talk

The invited talk is to be determined.
