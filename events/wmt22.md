## Tasks

The *News* machine translation task will be renamed the *General* machine translation task.

### General machine translation

- Multi-domain direction

> Blind tests for all languages will contain (up to) four different domains. Likely news, social, conversational, and e-commerce.

- Aggregated blind testsets across tasks

> Participants from each shared task will translate blind testsets from other shared tasks if given language pair is shared. This will allow comparisons of participants across tasks. Each shared task will evaluate their blind testsets separately.

- Rethinking human evaluation

- Removing 10 hours annotation per primary system requirement

> Instead, participants will be required to submit a system description paper if they submit the primary system.

- Pre-trained models in constrained setup allowed


#### Language pairs

Confirmed language pairs:
- Chinese-English
- Czech-English
- German-English
- German-French
- Japanese-English
- Russian-English

To be announced:
- Low-resource language pairs
