- The webinar was organised by <a href='/companies#omniscien-technologies'>Omniscien</a>.
  <br> This webinar will demonstrate how Omniscienâ€™s team gathers and synthesizes
  billions of sentences of training data that is used to teach and adapt AI systems.
  We will explore best practices and explain the limitations of traditional approaches.
  We will show how to use AI to create many millions of sentences of training data
  that can be used as part of domain adaptation. Essentially, this means using one
  form of AI to teach another AI form new knowledge.
