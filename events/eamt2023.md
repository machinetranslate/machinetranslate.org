- Implementing open-source machine translation (for example, strategies to get support, reports on taking pilot results into full deployment, examples of advanced customisation sought and obtained thanks to the open-source paradigm, collaboration within open-source machine translation projects)
- Evaluating machine translation in a real-world setting (for example, error detection strategies employed, metrics used, productivity or translation quality gains achieved)
- Ethical and confidentiality issues when using machine translation, especially machine translation in the cloud
- Using machine translation in social networking or real-time communication (for example, enterprise support chat, multilingual content for social media)
- Machine translation and usability
- Implementing machine translation to process multilingual content for assimilation purposes (for example, cross-lingual information retrieval, machine translation for e-discovery or spam detection, machine translation for highly dynamic content)
- Machine translation in literary, audiovisual, game localization and creative texts
- Impact of machine translation and post-editing on translation practices and the profession: processes, effort, compensation
- Psycho-social aspects of machine translation adoption (ergonomics, motivation, and social impact on the profession)
- Error analysis and post-editing strategies (including automatic post-editing and automation strategies)
- The use of translators‚Äô metadata and user activity data in machine translation development
- Freelance translators‚Äô independent use of machine translation

#### Products & Projects

**Products**

- Tools for machine translation
- Computer-aided translation
- Other translation technologies (including commercial products and free/open-source software).

**Projects**

- Research projects, funded through grants obtained in competitive public or private calls related to machine translation.

> There will be a poster boaster session for this track, in which authors will have 120 seconds to attract attendees to their posters or demos with a two-slide presentation.

#### Best thesis awards 2023

> The EAMT Best Thesis Award 2023 for PhD theses defended during 2022 will be awarded at the conference, together with a presentation of the winner‚Äôs work. Information for candidates for the award will be available soon.

## Call for workshops

> EAMT workshops are intended to provide the opportunity for MT-related communities of interest to spend focused time together advancing the state of thinking or the state of practice in their area of interest or endeavour. Workshops are generally scheduled as full-day events.

[events.tuni.fi/eamt23/call-for-workshop-proposals/](https://events.tuni.fi/eamt23/call-for-workshop-proposals/)

## Call for tutorials

> The aim of a tutorial is primarily to help the audience to develop understanding of particular technical, applied, and business matters related to research, development, and use of MT and translation technology.
