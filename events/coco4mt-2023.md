## Call for papers

> CoCo4MT sets out to be a  workshop centered around research that focuses on corpora creation, cleansing, and augmentation techniques specifically for machine translation.
> We hope that submissions will provide high-quality corpora that is available publicly for download and can be used to increase machine translation performance thus encouraging new dataset creation for multiple languages that will, in turn, provide a general workshop to consult for corpora needs in the future. 

Topics (not limited):
- Difficulties with using existing corpora (for example, political considerations or domain limitations), and their effects on final machine translation systems
- Strategies for collecting new machine translation datasets (for example, via crowdsourcing)
- Data augmentation techniques
- Data cleansing and denoising techniques
- Quality control strategies for machine translation data
- Exploration of datasets for pretraining or auxiliary tasks for training machine translation systems
