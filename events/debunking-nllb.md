- The speaker was Félix do Carmo, from the Centre of Translation Studies at the University
  of Surrey. <br> The talk was part of the Language in the human-machine era project.
  <br> In the talk, Félix will show how the language used in scientific papers published
  by the machine translation community, sometimes inadvertently, creates false beliefs
  in the power of this technology. <br> Concepts like ‘zero-shot translation’, ‘interlingua’,
  ‘human parity’ and the assumptions created by the No language left behind paper
  will be presented. <br> The analysis focuses on what is written in those papers,
  but the critical perspective comes from the basic concepts in Translation Studies.
