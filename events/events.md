## Frauds

### ICMTCS

The International Conference on Machine Translation and Cognitive Science is a fraudulent event created by [WASET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Academy_of_Science,_Engineering_and_Technology).

> The publisher has been listed as a "potential, possible, or probable" predatory publisher by Jeffrey Beall and is listed as such by the Max Planck Society and Stop Predatory Journals.

WASET was registered in Azerbaijan by a family of scammers operating out of Turkey.
