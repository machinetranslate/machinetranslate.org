- The event is sponsored by Translated. <br> The event is organised by TAUS. <br>The
  AI revolution is changing the landscape of the global translation industry with
  language being at the core of AI. This is opening up an abundance of opportunities
  for the traditional translation industry. Advanced business models, more efficient
  workflows, evolving professions and state-of-the-art technologies are developing.
  Over the course of two days, TAUS will put all of these topics and more on the table,
  to be discussed and brainstormed with 50+ attendees of the TAUS events in Tokyo
  2024.
