- The speaker was Doctor FÃ©lix do Carmo, from the Centre of Translation Studies at
  the University of Surrey. <br> In this lecture, I will present a critical view of
  three of the most influential papers from machine translation research, not criticising
  their scientific validity, but highlighting how their use of terms and concepts
  helped create myths around the power of machine translation.
