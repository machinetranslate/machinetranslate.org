The nineteenth Machine Translation Summit 2023 (**MTS 2023**) will take place from 4 September to 8 September in Macau Special Administrative Region, China.
MTS 2023 is organised by [AAMT](/associations/aamt.md).

> Machine Translation (MT) Summit is an international conference, which brings together people from the academic and commercial world developing MT and users of MT systems. The conference overviews state-of-the-art technologies in MT, its major contemporary trends, and practical applications.

## Workshops

### WAT 2023

> The Workshop on Asian Translation (WAT) is an open machine translation evaluation campaign focusing on Asian languages. WAT gathers and shares the resources and knowledge of Asian language translation to understand the problems to be solved for the practical use of machine translation technologies among all Asian countries.

### ALT 2023：Ancient Language Translation Workshop

> This workshop aims to provide an opportunity for practitioners and scholars of interest to learn about the challenges and latest developments in the field of machine translation for ancient languages. Participants will engage in discussions and hands-on activities to develop a deeper understanding of the field and the techniques used to address the unique challenges posed by translating texts written in ancient languages.

### Users Track

#### Downstream applications of machine translation

- Use of MT in pedagogical, translation and language learning contexts, leading to the development of new technical and linguistic competences
- Use of machine translation in specialized communication domains and for specialized uses, like healthcare, justice, literature and arts
- Development of innovative and fair pricing models for services based on machine translation
- Consumer rights and producers’ responsibility in machine translation for assimilation and in machine translation for dissemination
- Impact of the use of machine translation in client-facing environments
- Machine translation back-translation as a process to generate synthetic data
- Integration of machine translation in multimodal communication, integrated with speech recognition, text dictation, image identification and captioning, voice synthesis, intralingual respeaking, audio-description, and others
- Integration of machine translation in production workflows that involve automatic post-editing, quality estimation and fine-tuning steps
- Translation process and post-editing process analysis with user activity data, including cognitive data, namely for better coverage of translation effort and density of editing in the use of machine translation

#### Innovative evaluation of uses of machine translation

- Societal contributions of the use of machine translation, as with low-resource languages and in contexts of crisis, and applications that show community engagement
- Return on investment (ROI) of the use of machine translation in business scenarios
- Dynamic and holistic quality assessment models, reflecting textual and extra-textual factors
- Data security, regulation compliance and technology integration of machine translation
- Ethical concerns about the uses of MT: impact over users, translators, factors of risk, liability and legal implications
- Quality control procedures in industrial production scenarios, through the use of industry standards, usage guidelines and quality control metrics, besides integration with terminology, grammar checking and other quality assurance tools and components
- Exploration and extension of notions related to augmentation of translation, dynamic quality, multidimensionality of translation, based on the use of machine translation in innovative and creative services
- Proposals for innovative perspectives and conceptualizations over the use of machine translation, which bring about questions not usually addressed by engineering approaches
- Impact of the use of machine translation on the management of concurrent translation online platforms
- Adoption of machine translation by diverse populations of users, across countries, demographics, cultural and social spectrums

## Call for workshops and tutorials

Workshops and tutorials will take place on 4 September and 5 September, 2023.

**Chairs:** Thepchai Supnithi, Jiajun Zhang
mt-summit-2023-workshop@googlegroups.com
mt-summit-2023-tutorial@googlegroups.com

### Workshops

> We welcome not only proposals on deeply technical research and development topics but also on, for instance, the collection and curation of training data, best practices in training MT systems, human/computer interaction among translators, interpreters, and other users of MT output, and the evolving role of translation automation in the commercial translation production pipeline. Topics about machine translation on Asian languages are especially welcome.

### Tutorials

> Tutorials are a forum for experts in MT and MT-related areas to deliver concentrated training on a topic of interest in half-day teaching sessions.
