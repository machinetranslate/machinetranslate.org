- The webinar was organised by <a href='/omniscien-technologies'>Omniscien</a>. <br>Artificial
  Intelligence (AI) has fundamentally reshaped our understanding and processing of
  human language, led by Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents. These powerful
  systems comprehend and generate human-like text using deep learning techniques and
  vast datasets while agents use natural language processing (NLP) to interact with
  their environments. However, the one-size-fits-all training approach, as evidenced
  by OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, often hampers task-specific proficiency and
  organizational knowledge and poses data privacy and compliance risks. <br> Addressing
  these concerns involves refining AI models with affordable fine-tuning tools tailored
  to unique application requirements, allowing businesses to quickly adapt AI models
  with their proprietary data, securely processing requests within their corporate
  networks. Furthermore, using natural language APIs atop tailored AI models can enable
  secure self-hosted agents to interact with an extensive, curated toolkit, performing
  tasks like image generation, text summarisation, audio-video transcription and analysis,
  text-to-speech conversion, document-based Q&A, and generation of organization-specific
  content. <br> Amid the overwhelming noise around AI, this webinar aims to clarify
  the state of relevant technologies. Omniscien's AI experts will share their vision
  of a promising enterprise AI future powered by fine-tuning tools and natural Language
  APIs, reinforced by secure, self-hosted agents, and will showcase the existing and
  future features of Omniscien's Language Studio platform to illustrate what is already
  achievable.
