- The webinar was organised by <a href='/companies#omniscien-technologies'>Omniscien</a>.
  <br>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has fundamentally reshaped our understanding and
  processing of human language, led by Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents.
  These powerful systems comprehend and generate human-like text using deep learning
  techniques and vast datasets while agents use natural language processing (NLP)
  to interact with their environments. However, the one-size-fits-all training approach,
  as evidenced by OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, often hampers task-specific
  proficiency and organizational knowledge and poses data privacy and compliance risks.
  <br> Addressing these concerns involves refining AI models with affordable fine-tuning
  tools tailored to unique application requirements, allowing businesses to quickly
  adapt AI models with their proprietary data, securely processing requests within
  their corporate networks. Furthermore, using natural language APIs atop tailored
  AI models can enable secure self-hosted agents to interact with an extensive, curated
  toolkit, performing tasks like image generation, text summarisation, audio-video
  transcription and analysis, text-to-speech conversion, document-based Q&A, and generation
  of organization-specific content. <br> Amid the overwhelming noise around AI, this
  webinar aims to clarify the state of relevant technologies. Omniscien's AI experts
  will share their vision of a promising enterprise AI future powered by fine-tuning
  tools and natural Language APIs, reinforced by secure, self-hosted agents, and will
  showcase the existing and future features of Omniscien's Language Studio platform
  to illustrate what is already achievable.
