- Lexicon acquisition and integration into MT
- MT for low resource languages
- Model distillation, compression, and on-device MT
- MT in production scenarios, robustness and deployment issues.
- MT for multiple modalities (speech, optical character recognition)
- MT for communication (chats, blogs, social networks)
- Few-shot adaptation of pre-trained MT systems
- Deep integration of MT technology within translation and localization pipelines
- Large-scale mining of translation resources
- Computer Assisted Translation (CAT)
- MT evaluation
- Measuring fairness, bias, transparency in translation
- Detecting and preventing catastrophic errors in translation
- Best practices in annotation for translation
- Other

> We invite original, substantial, and unpublished research in all aspects of machine translation (MT).

Submission requirements:

- Maximum 10-page paper (unlimited for reference pages)
- Follow the style guides ([PDF version](https://amtaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/amta2022.pdf), [LaTeX version](https://amtaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AMTA-2022-Template.zip), [MS Word version](https://amtaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/amta2022.docx)) and submit in PDF format
- Do not include author names and affiliations
- Represent new work that has not been previously published

> Authors submitting a similar paper to another conference or workshop must specify this at submission time; if the paper is accepted to multiple venues, the author must choose which one to present at.

- Papers must be submitted via the [Submission website](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/User/Login?ReturnUrl=%2FAMTA2022)

#### Users and providers

Chairs: Janice Campbell, Jay Marciano, Konstantin Savenkov, Alex Yanishevsky (mtusers-providers@amtaweb.org)

> This track is intended for users, providers, and developers of machine translation, as well as professional translators and Language Service Providers, to present novel, original, and unpublished applications of machine translation technology or specific commercial use cases.

> We seek submissions for 15-20-minute presentations (including a few minutes for questions and discussion) concerning the use of MT and/or related tools, processes, and technologies to support business goals and serve the customer or user in commercial settings.

Topics:

- Domain adaptation and customisation of MT models: commercial customisation platforms, implementation of open frameworks, and comparison of methodologies used to adapt and customize baseline engines.
- Data preparation: data sources, extraction, alignment, and cleaning of corpora, terminology, data augmentation, metadata extraction, working with data drift.
- MT for low-resource languages: language pairs with limited data; cross-dialect and cross-domain translation.
- Comparison and evaluation of MT systems: with respect to business, technical and linguistic requirements.
- MT output quality and confidence scoring: tools, methods, and metrics, such as human evaluations, automatic scoring, and MTQE.
- Advanced MT fine-tuning and enhancement: including pre- and post-processing; controlling style, tone of voice, gender, pseudonymisation; automatic post-editing (APE).
- Interactive and real-time adaptive MT systems: including advanced approaches to leverage TM and end-user feedback.
- MT Post-Editing: New approaches to MTPE, success and failure stories, applicability to different content-types, MTPE training, defining fair pricing models and working with translation buyers and providers.
- Technical challenges to MT adoption: file format and tag support, integration, security, performance, data protection, profanity filters, locality, and compliance.
- Business Cases: making the business case for adopting MT to drive business requirements, expand markets and engage with customers. Post-edited MT, real-time MT, cross-language information retrieval.
- Augmenting MT with ML and NLP: classification, context awareness, content moderation, sentiment analysis, OCR, ASR, and TTS.
- Source text improvement: improving the source content destined for MT through automatic tools such as grammar correction, guidelines, and NLP.
- Video localization: MT usage in video localization workflows, including captioning, subtitling, and voiceovers.
- Other

Submission requirements:

- Abstract: 250 to 500-word

#### Tutorials

> Tutorials are a forum for experts in MT and MT-related areas to deliver concentrated training on a topic of interest in half-day teaching sessions. Tutorials help conference participants enrich their understanding of specific technical, applied, and business matters surrounding research, development and use of MT and associated technologies, or, in the case of tutorials designed for newcomers, provide background information that facilitates greater understanding of the overall conference program.
