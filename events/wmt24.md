scientific_papers:
- topics:
  - Machine translation models (neural, statistical etc.)
  - Analysis of neural models
  - Using comparable corpora
  - Selection and preparation of data
  - Semi-supervised and unsupervised learning for machine translation, transfer learning
  - Multilingual machine translation
  - Incorporating linguistic information into machine translation
  - Machine translation inference
  - Manual and automatic methods for evaluating machine translation
  - Quality estimation
  research_papers:
  - Research papers should describe original research corresponding to the categories
    listed above. Research papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings
    or publications must indicate this at submission time, and must be withdrawn from
    the other venues if accepted and published at WMT 2024.
  - We will not accept for publication papers that overlap significantly in content
    or results with papers that have been or will be published elsewhere. It is acceptable
    to submit work that has been made available as a technical report (or similar,
    e.g. in arXiv) without citing it.
  - For the research track, papers should be anonymised, be between 6 and 10 pages
    in length (excluding references) and may include supplementary material.
  system_papers:
  - System papers must describe one or more shared task submissions. System paper
    submissions that we cannot link to a shared task submission will be rejected without
    review. System papers can overlap with other published work, and do not have to
    follow the double submission policy. There is no maximum length for system papers,
    but normally a short paper (4-6 pages) is appropriate. System papers should not
    be anonymised.
paper_submission:
- Papers must be submitted electronically.
- Research and system papers have the same deadlines.
- Research and system papers should follow EMNLP2024 formatting guidelines.
