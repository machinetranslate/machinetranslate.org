- ChatGPT 3.5 launched in November 2022, revolutionizing AI with sophisticated, accessible
  capabilities for all. While related to specialized AI like NMT and ASR, its adaptability
  sets it apart. The media spotlight highlighted opportunities and risks, with enterprises
  seizing opportunities and governments considering regulation. Italy banned ChatGPT,
  and many stakeholders raised ethical concerns. As hype subsides, realism and responsibility
  reemerge, as seen in Samsung's data loss incident. We explore secure, private language
  AI usage and discuss AI's future in augmenting human processes and secure enterprise
  applications.
