- Augmenting machine translation with machine learning, natural language processing or generative artificial intelligence
- Comparative evaluation of machine translation systems
- Interactive and real-time adaptive machine translation systems: including advanced approaches to leverage translation memories and end-user feedback
- Detecting and preventing catastrophic errors in output
- Measuring fairness, bias, and transparency in output
- Advanced machine translation fine-tuning and enhancement: including pre- and post-processing; controlling style, tone of voice, gender
- Technologies for machine translation deployment: quality estimation, domain adaptation, etc.
- Machine translation for multiple modalities (speech, sign language, video, etc.)
- Machine translation for real-time communication (chats, social networks, etc.)
- Machine translation in production scenarios, robustness and deployment issues
- Linguistic resources for machine translation: corpora, terminologies, dictionaries, etc.
- Machine translation quality estimation and evaluation techniques, metrics, and evaluation results
- Related multilingual technologies: natural language generation, information retrieval, text categorization, text summarization, information extraction, optical character recognition, etc.
- Source text improvement: improving the source content destined for machine translation through automatic tools such as grammar correction, guidelines, and natural language processing


**Chairs:** Marco Gaido (Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy)

### Research track - Translators and users


- The impact of machine translation and post-editing: including studies on processes, effort, strategies, usability, productivity, pricing, workflows, and post-editese
- Emerging areas for machine translation and post-editing: audiovisual, game localization, literary texts, creative texts, social media, health care communication, crisis translation
- Ethics, policy, and regulatory trends concerning the use of machine translation or generative artificial intelligence for cross-lingual use cases
- The evaluation and reception of different modalities of translation: human translation, post-edited, raw machine translation
- Machine translation and interpreting
- Post-editing and human-in-the-loop methods: new approaches, successes and failures, applicability to different content-types, etc.
- Interaction of language professionals (translators and interpreters) with machine translation and generative artificial intelligence tools and output
- Machine translation large language models integration in computer-aided tools environments and translation workflow
- Machine translation for gisting and the impact of machine translation on users: use cases, expectations, perceptions, trust, views on acceptability
- Machine translation and usability
- Machine translation and education/language learning
- Machine translation in the translation/interpreting classroom

**Chairs:** Joke Daems (Ghent University, Belgium) and Dorothy Kenny (Dublin City University, Ireland)


### Implementations and case studies


- Integrating or optimizing machine translation and computer-assisted translation in translation production workflows (translation memory/machine translation thresholds, mixing online and offline tools (using interactive machine translation, dealing with machine translation confidence scores)
- Managing change when implementing and using machine translation (e.g. switching between multiple machine translation systems, limiting degradations when updating or upgrading an machine translation system)
- Implementing open-source machine translation (e.g. strategies to get support, reports on taking pilot results into full deployment, examples of advanced customization sought and obtained thanks to the open-source paradigm, collaboration within open-source machine translation projects)
- Evaluating machine translation in a real-world setting (e.g. error detection strategies, metrics, productivity or translation quality gains)
- Ethical and confidentiality issues when using machine translation, especially machine translation in the cloud
- Using machine translation in social networking or real-time communication (e.g. enterprise support chat, multilingual content for social media)
- Machine translation and usability
- Implementing machine translation to process multilingual content for assimilation purposes (e.g. cross-lingual information retrieval, machine translation for e-discovery or spam detection, machine translation for highly dynamic content)
- Machine translation in literary, audiovisual, game localization and creative texts
- Impact of machine translation and post-editing on translation practices and the profession: processes, effort, compensation
- Psycho-social aspects of machine translation adoption (ergonomics, motivation, and social impact on the profession)
- Error analysis and post-editing strategies (including automatic post-editing and automation strategies)
- The use of translators’ metadata and user activity data in machine translation development
- Freelance translators’ independent use of machine translation
- MT and interpreting
- Generative AI and Large language models integration in translation workflows

**Chairs:** Samuel Läubli (Textshuttle/Supertext, Switzerland) and Martin Volk (University of Zurich, Switzerland)


### Products and projects

**Products**: Tools for machine translation, computer-aided translation, and other translation technologies.

**Projects**:  Research projects, funded through grants obtained in competitive public or private calls related to machine translation.

There will be a poster boaster session for this track, in which authors will have 120 seconds to attract attendees to their posters or demos with a two-slide presentation.

**Chairs:** Miquel Esplà-Gomis (University of Alicante, Spain) and Vincent Vandeghinste (KU Leuven, Belgium)


### Tutorials


> We seek proposals in all areas of machine translation, LLMs applied to translation, computer-assisted translation technologies, spoken language translation and related topics.
> 
> The aim of a tutorial is primarily to help the audience to develop understanding of specific technical, applied, and business matters related to research, development, and use of MT and translation technology.
> 
> Presentations of specific technological solutions or systems are welcome, provided that they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations. 

**Chairs:** Sheila Castilho (Dublin City University, Ireland) and François Yvon (Sorbonne Université, France)


### Workshops


>MT Summit workshops are intended to provide the opportunity for MT-related communities of interest to spend focused time together advancing the state of thinking or the state of practice in their area of interest or endeavour. We seek proposals in all areas of machine translation, LLMs applied to translation, computer-assisted translation technologies, spoken language translation and related topics.
>
>Workshops may be scheduled as half-day or full-day events (up to 8 hours, including coffee and lunch breaks). Proponents need to explicitly state the duration of the workshop. 

**Chairs:** Sheila Castilho (Dublin City University, Ireland) and François Yvon (Sorbonne University, France)
