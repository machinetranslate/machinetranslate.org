- Generative AI and the Future of Machine Translation will focus on advances in cross-lingual
  technology and processes that leverage Large Language Models. Moving beyond the
  explosion of hype that began with the general availability of ChatGPT in November
  2022, this event is intended as a forum for a thoughtful exchange of ideas informed
  by a year of successes and failures in applying Large Language Models to the challenges
  of cross-lingual communication and data processing. <br> Generative AI and the Future
  of Machine Translation included a keynote talk, expert panel discussions, presentations,
  tutorials for both beginners and more experienced practitioners, and demonstrations
  from technology providers.
