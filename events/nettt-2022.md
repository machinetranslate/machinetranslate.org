- Machine Translation (any MT-related research activity including Neural Machine Translation, from development to human factors, MT in literary texts, MT in AVT, MT in localisation, MT and creative texts, MT and interpreting)
- CAT tools (Translation Memory (TM) systems, integration of MT in TM systems)
- Quality assessment and quality control
- MT evaluation techniques, metrics, and evaluation results
- Speech Technology
- Terminology management
- Crowdsourcing
- Translation Workflow and Management
- Training (to include university programmes on translation and interpreting and training in this fast-changing industry)
- New and emerging language and mobile technologies
- Tools and resources that can support the work of translators, localisers, subtitlers and interpreters, Linguistic resources for MT e.g. dictionaries, termbases, corpora, etc.
- Human and cognitive factors in MT and user interfaces
- Ethical issues in translation and technology
- NLP support for translation
- MT integration with NLP tasks

### (B) User track topics

NeTTT invites two types of abstract submissions:  

- proposals for oral presentations: 750 words (+ references)
- proposals for poster presentations: 500 words (+ references)

The submission will be electronic at [softconf.com/j/nettt2022/](https://www.softconf.com/j/nettt2022/).
Authors will have to state to which track they are submitting.   

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other conferences or publications must be marked as such at the time of submission in the START submission form.
A paper to be published at NeTTT must be withdrawn from other conferences.  

## Templates

Submissions are not blind.
Authors will state their names and affiliations.

## Summer school on Neural Machine Translation

> The objective of the NMT summer school is to provide students, academics and practitioners with an overview of the state of the art as well as training through advanced lectures and practical sessions.
