A paper to be published at NeTTT must be withdrawn from other conferences.  

## Templates

Submissions are not blind.
Authors will state their names and affiliations.

## Summer school on Neural Machine Translation

> The objective of the NMT summer school is to provide students, academics and practitioners with an overview of the state of the art as well as training through advanced lectures and practical sessions.
