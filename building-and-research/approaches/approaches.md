    name: Approaches to machine translation
---

The earliest machine translation systems were built with [*rule-based* approaches](rule-based-machine-translation.md).

By the 2010s, the top systems, like Google Translate, used [*statistical* machine translation](/approaches/statistical-machine-translation.md) (SMT).
Statistical machine translation is also known as [phrase-based machine translation](https://machinetranslate.org/statistical-machine-translation#approaches) (PBMT).

By the 2020s, the top systems used [*neural machine* translation](neural-machine-translation.md).
A few of the neural systems launched an [adaptive customisation](/customisation/adaptive.md) feature.

Each paradigm shift made machine translation systems more accurate and also easier to build.
The result was more [language support](/languages/languages.md) and more production systems from more [companies](/industry/companies.md).
