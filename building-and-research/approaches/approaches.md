---

The earliest machine translation systems were built with [*rule-based* approaches](/rule-based-machine-translation).

By the 2010s, the top systems, like Google Translate, used [*statistical* machine translation](/statistical-machine-translation) (SMT).
Statistical machine translation is also known as [phrase-based machine translation](https://machinetranslate.org/statistical-machine-translation#approaches) (PBMT).

By the 2020s, the top systems used [*neural machine* translation](/neural-machine-translation).
A few of the neural systems launched an [adaptive customisation](/adaptive) feature.

Each paradigm shift made machine translation systems more accurate and also easier to build.
The result was more [language support](/languages) and more production systems from more [companies](/companies).
