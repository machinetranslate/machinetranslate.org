**Translation Error Rate** (**TER**)  is a metric for automatic evaluation of machine translation that calculates the number of edits required to change a machine translation output into one of the references.

> TER is defined as the minimum number of edits needed to change a hypothesis so that it exactly matches one of the references, normalized by the average length of the references.
