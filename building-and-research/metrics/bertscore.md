description: Evaluation metric using BERT sentence representations
---

**BERTScore** is a metric for automatic evaluation of machine translation that calculates the similarity between a machine translation output and a reference translation using sentence representation.

BERTScore was invented as an improvement on [n-gram](/../concepts/n-gram.md)-based metrics like [BLEU](bleu.md).

> For example, given a small window of size two, BLEU will only mildly penalize swapping of cause and effect clauses (e.g. A because B instead of B because A), especially when the arguments A and B are long phrases.

The BERTScore metric uses sentence representations from BERT, a deep learning model.
