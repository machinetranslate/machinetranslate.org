There is a growing set of machine translation APIs available.

The most popular APIs are available as self-serve APIs and support more than 100 [languages](/languages/languages.md) and more than 10000 language pairs.  By 2022, there was a self-serve API that supported more than 300 languages.

Besides language and locale support, the APIs also vary by features like customisation, privacy policies and whether or not they are self-service products.  Many of the APIs have been integrated into translation management systems (TMS) where human translators work to [post-edit](https://machinetranslate.org/post-editing) machine translation output.

Most of the underlying machine translation systems are now based on [neural machine translation](/approaches/neural-machine-translation.md).

Here the APIs are ordered by the number of languages and [locales](/applications/advanced-concepts/locale.md) that each support.
