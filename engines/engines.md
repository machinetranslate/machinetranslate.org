There is a growing set of machine translation engines available.

The most popular engines are available as self-serve APIs and support more than 100 languages and more than 10000 language pairs.  By 2022, there was a self-serve API that supported more than 300 languages.

The underlying machine translation systems are mostly [neural machine translation](/approaches/neural-machine-translation.md).

Here the APIs are ordered by the number of languages and locales that each support.
