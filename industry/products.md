Machine translation products include ready-to-use machine translation APIs and applications.  Systems can also be made available via integrations.

They vary by:

- language support
- accuracy
- price
- customization options
- data confidentiality

and other features, as well as underlying architecture.


An advantage of using a machine translation provider is that the service is already working and can be integrated immediately. An alternative to using a machine translation provider is to train a model from scratch or to use a pre-trained model, and deploy and maintain a machine translation system.

Unlike raw models, production machine translation systems usually provide language identification and sentence segmentation.

Providers offer machine translation services via a platform, an API or both. Some providers offer limited services for free or paid full services.
