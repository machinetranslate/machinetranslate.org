Machine translation products include ready-to-use machine translation APIs and applications.  Systems can also be made available via integrations.

They vary by:

- language support
- accuracy
- price
- customisation options
- [data confidentiality](data-confidentiality.md)
and other features, as well as underlying architecture.

Some providers offer ready-to-use systems that can be integrated immediately.  These usually support many language pairs and their infrastructure is scalable.  An alternative is to train a model from scratch — or to use a pre-trained model — and deploy and maintain it.

Raw models usually do not include the features included in many production systems:
- language identification
- segmentation
- bridging (pivoting)
- [glossary](/customisation/glossaries)
- encoding options
- HTML/XML tag handling
