**Data confidentiality** terms or policies govern how machine translation providers use client data.

Machine translation providers use client data to train and improve their translation systems. Confidential data for machine translation include:

- Client consumer user data

Data confidentiality terms or policies ensure that machine translation providers comply with:

- Contracts
- Laws, regulation, and standards, like HIPAA or GDPR
- Security reviews

### Data types

- Training data - parallel data
- Request data - original input


###  Approaches

- Client-specific - The data is not used to train models for any other clients.
- No-trace - The request data is never stored, but only in memory for the lifetime of the request.
- Encryption - The training and request data are not human-readable.
- Auto-delete - The request data is cached, and deleted after a set time period, for example after 72 hours.
- Delete on request - The training data or request data is deleted upon the client's request.
- On-premise deployment ("on-prem")
- On-device models


### Risk types

Confidential data can be exposed when:

- Training data is accessed.
- Request data is accessed.
- Training data is included as part of translation output.
