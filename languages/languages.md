description: Languages supported by machine translation APIs
---

More than a hundred languages and locales are supported by more than one [machine translation API](/apis/apis.md).

Most engines support translation between any two language that they support.
Some engines only support translation to and from a major language, like English.

Here the languages are ordered by the number of APIs that support them.
