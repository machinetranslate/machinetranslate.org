description: Machine translation for Russian

# Russian

Russian was one of the first languages for which machine translation was researched and developed, and remains one of the best supported languages.

Among those languages, it is notable for:

* complex morphology - highly inflected, with gender agreement
* monocentric - little dialect variation

Russian has the best machine translation support among Slavic languages and languages written in the Cyrillic alphabet.

## Support

By 2020, Russian was supported by all the major translation application and API providers, including Google Translate, Yandex Translate, Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, ModernMT and DeepL.

English-Russian and Russian-English are the highest traffic language pairs for Yandex Translate.

Russian-Chinese and Chinese-Russian are also significant translation pairs.

## History

In 1935, [Petr Troyanskii](/people/petr-troyanskii.md) filed a USSR Patent 40995 on machine translation.

During the Cold War, English and Russian were the most important languages geopolitically, and much machine translation research and development was for defense and intelligence agencies.

In the 2010s, while most providers used bridging or pivoting via English for most language pairs, Yandex Translate launched direct translation between Russian and many languages.
