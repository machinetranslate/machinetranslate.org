**Training data** is the data used to train a model.
In other words, the training algorithm sets the model parameters to fit the training data.

The most common type of training data in machine translation is [parallel text data](/parallel-data).
Monolingual text data is also often used for learning, for instance in [language models](/language-model) or [back-translating](/back-translation) the monolingual data to generate synthetic parallel data.
