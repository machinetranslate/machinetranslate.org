description: A unique list of numbers

A **vector** is a unique fixed-sized list of numbers.
Each vector number is called a coordinate.
Coordinates define the vector's position in a particular space.
Vectors represent data in a way that a machine learning model can understand and use.
In machine translation, vectors represent the words and phrases in a text.

Example of a vector:

`cat` = [0.049, 0.121, 0.503, 0.888]

Each coordinate corresponds to a specific aspect of the word or phrase.

Vectors encode information:

- Meaning and sense
- Part of speech
- Grammatical features, like verb tense or noun case
- Relationship to other words in the sentence

Vectors are used as algorithms input.
Algorithms analyse the vector meaning to produce the corresponding translation.

For example, vectors can help to identify a sentence subject and verb, and then use this information to generate a translation.

Vectors can also be used to represent the relationship between different parts of a text.
For example, a vector can represent the similarity between two sentences.

Vectors can be useful to identify output sentences that are grammatically correct, but are not accurate translations.
