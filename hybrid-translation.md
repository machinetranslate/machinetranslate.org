# Hybrid translation

In a **hybrid translation** workflow, some raw machine translations are never seen or touched by a human translator.

Hybrid translation can be faster and cheaper than full [post-editing](post-editing.md) \(human translation\).  It requires machine translation to be accurate enough that a signification portion of the machine translations are usable as-is.

The key technology for a hybrid translation workflow is translation risk prediction.  Each machine translation is automatically classified as high-risk or low-risk.  A low-risk line is automatically approved as-is, while a high-risk line is checked and, if necessary, post-edited by a human translator.
