An **adaptive machine translation** system learns from human feedback and adapts its output on the fly. Adaptive machine translation is applicable to [post-editing](/workflows/post-editing.md) workflows.

In adaptive machine translation, the system is customised while the human post-editor fixes the machine translation output, instead of after batch retraining.

Adaptive machine translation is an example of online machine learning and human-in-the-loop (HITL).

### Companies

In 2019, ModernMT launched adaptive machine translation.

In 2020, Amazon Translate launched Active Custom Translation, an adaptive machine translation feature.

### Workflow

1. The engine generates a machine translated output.
2. The output is fixed or approved.
3. The engine learns from the correction.
4. The system reduces the chance of repeating the error.

Adaptive machine translation reduces the time a human takes to edit a machine translation suggestion.
