**Training data** is the data used for learning model parameters.
The most common type of training data in machine translation is [parallel text data](parallel-data.md).
Monolingual text data is also often used for learning, for instance in [language models](/concepts/language-model.md) or [back-translating](/customisation/back-translation.md) the monolingual data to generate synthetic parallel data.
