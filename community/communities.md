## Communities

### MT Literacy

**MT Literacy** is a teaching and research project that encourages awareness by describing the opportunities and limitations related to using machine translation.

> We aim to help users learn how to use MT critically in order to maximize its effectiveness. This includes deciding whether MT is the right tool for a job, evaluating whether information is too sensitive to paste into a free online tool, learning how to write in a translation-friendly way, recognizing common (and not-so-common) MT errors, and learning how to fix them.

MT Literacy was founded in 2019.

MT Literacy is funded by the Government of Canada through the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.

### MaCoCu

**MaCocu** creates open high quality parallel corpora to improve machine translation for the European Commission.

> **MaCoCu** focuses on collecting monolingual and parallel data from the Internet, specially for under-resourced languages and DSI-specific data.

MaCoCu started in June 2021 and will take place until June 2023.
In May 2022, MaCoCu published the first batch of monolingual and parallel corpora, covering Turkish, Bulgarian, Croatian, Slovene, Macedonian, Icelandic and Maltese.

MaCoCu is lead by multiple groups:
- Transducens research group (University of Alicante)
- Prompsit
- Computational Linguistics research group (University of Groningen)
- Department of Knowledge Technologies (Jožef Stefan Institute)

MaCoCu is co-financed by Connecting Europe Facility, from the European Union.
