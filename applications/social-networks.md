# Social networks

Machine translation is integrated into **social networks** for gisting dynamic content on demand.

Social networks with a machine translation feature include:

* Facebook
* Twitter
* LinkedIn
* Instagram
* Sina Weibo
* YouTube

While the static content of social networks is human-translated, machine translation is used for [user-generated content](https://github.com/machinetranslate/machinetranslate.org/tree/415ba6e66b12dcd38178a7a4a36cf01cc08e18c2/applications/applications/user-generated-content.md).

## Content types

* Comments
* Reviews
* Posts
* Messages

On YouTube, machine translation is for subtitles, including autogenerated subtitles.
