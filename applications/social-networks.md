Machine translation is integrated into **social networks** for gisting dynamic content on demand.

Social networks with a machine translation feature include:

* Facebook
* Twitter
* LinkedIn
* Instagram
* Sina Weibo
* YouTube

While the static content of social networks is human-translated, machine translation is used for [user-generated content](user-generated-content.md).

## Content types

* Comments
* Reviews
* Posts
* Messages

On YouTube, machine translation is for subtitles, including autogenerated subtitles.
