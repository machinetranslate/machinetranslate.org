description: Machine translation for user-generated content
---

Machine translation for **user-generated content** \(**UGC**\) is used mainly for **gisting**.

## Goals

Platforms translate their content to increase key metrics, like user engagement and sales.
User-generated content is a good fit for machine translation because it is continuous and high-scale.

User-generated content is challenging for machine translation because it is open-domain and noisy.

## Content types

* [Posts and comments](/social-networks)
* [Live chat](/live-chat)
* [Product titles, descriptions and reviews](/commerce-and-marketplaces)
* [In-game content](/gaming)
