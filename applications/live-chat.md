# Live chat

Machine translation for **live chat** is used to translate messages between two users who do not speak a common language.

Live chat messages are a type of [user-generated content](user-generated-content.md). Live chat is challenging for machine translation because it is noisy and context-dependent.

Common scenarios are in-game chat in [gaming](gaming.md) and customer support for [commerce and marketplaces](commerce-and-marketplaces.md).

Many commercial chat applications that have incorporated machine translation for live chat:

- Skype
- Telegram
- WeChat
- Line
