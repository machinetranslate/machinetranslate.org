# Tags and placeholders

In-line **tags and placeholders** can negatively impact the machine translation quality when the engine cannot interpret what they are. In many cases, the machine translation treats these marks as delimiters or ordinary words, misplacing, corrupting or ignoring them.

## Examples

### Tags

Tags format and structure texts.

An example of a common issue is the treatment of the genitive apostrophe when it is coded as a tag. For instance, if the phrase "Susan's car" is translated into Spanish, the output will contain the apostrophe, which introduces an error.

### Placeholders

Placeholders are variables for dynamic content.

In gendered languages, sentences with placeholders need special attention at the time of translation because they may stand for gendered words, which modify the rest of the sentence.
