# Tags and placeholders

**Tags and placeholders** are pieces of non-translatable code. While tags format and structure texts, placeholders are variables for dynamic content.

## Challenges

- The machine translation can misplace, corrupt or ignore tags and placeholders.

In a phrase like "Susan's car", the genitive apostrophe can appear as a tag. When translated into Spanish, the appearance of the tag in the output introduces an error.

- The machine translation output quality can be degraded when the final content replaces tags and placeholders.

For example, placeholders can be replaced by a singular or plural value. Also, in gendered languages, a placeholder can stand for gendered words. These values are retrieved after the text has been translated.
