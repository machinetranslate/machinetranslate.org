description: Two-step translation through an intermediate language
---

**Bridging** uses an intermediate language to translate between source and target languages.
If a language pair `(source, target)` is desired, bridging translates twice: `(source, bridge)`, then `(bridge, target)`. 
The `bridge` language is also called a pivot language. 

English is a common choice for the bridge because many languages have training data with English.

## Applications

- Translation without parallel data
- Paraphrasing in a single language
