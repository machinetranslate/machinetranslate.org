description: Workflow for human translation with sentence completion
---

**Interactive translation prediction** (**ITP**) or **interactive machine translation** (**IMT**) helps human translators type translations with a predictive text input system.
Unlike traditional predictive text, interactive translation prediction uses the machine translation model to provide better completions of the sentence.

## Challenges

- It can be challenging to combine probabilities from the target-side language model with the machine translation model.
