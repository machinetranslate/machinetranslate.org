# Translation and localization

Machine translation is a key technology in professional **translation and localization** workflows.

### Integrations

Translation software, like translation management systems and CAT tools, integrate machine translation APIs, directly or via plugins.

### Workflow

The translation software fills in the machine translation for the human translator to [post-edit](/applications/post-edition.md). The machine translation can be inserted in whole files at once or one line at a time. Some engines that translate line-by-line can learn from post-editions and adapt the machine translation output accordingly.

### Productivity

Post-editors work three to four times faster than traditional translators.
