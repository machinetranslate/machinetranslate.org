# Multilingual search

Machine translation for **multilingual search** is the automatic translation of website content at the time of its indexing. The purpose of indexing is to help users retrieve the data they want. When search indexes are translated, users looking for information in different languages, or even alphabets, find relevant results.

Users can use different terms to search for the same data. This is a challenge for machine translation since many names and terms can have different possible translations and transliterations.
