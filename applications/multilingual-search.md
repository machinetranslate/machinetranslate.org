description: Machine translation for multilingual search
---

Machine translation is implemented in **multilingual search** so that users can search in one language and get results in another. In multilingual search, platforms translate both the index and the query.

Users can use different terms to search for the same data. This is a challenge for machine translation since many names and terms can have different possible translations and transliterations.
