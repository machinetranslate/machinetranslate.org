description: Workflow with both human translations and pure machine translations
---

In a **hybrid translation** workflow, some raw machine translations are never seen or touched by a human translator.

Hybrid translation can be faster and cheaper than full human [post-editing](post-editing.md).

Hybrid translation requires good machine translation.  A signification portion of the machine translated segments should be usable as-is.

A risk **threshold** is set.  Each new machine translation is automatically classified as high-risk or low-risk.

A low-risk machine translation is machine-approved as-is.

A high-risk translation is still sent to a human translator for post-editing.

In the translation management system (TMS) and computer-aided translation (CAT) tool, the machine-approved machine translations are handled like translation memory matches.  They are either locked or marked as approved.

### Technology

The key technology for a hybrid translation workflow is [**translation risk prediction**](/../quality/quality-estimation.md).
