description: Approaches to machine translation

The earliest machine translation systems were built with [*rule-based* approaches](rule-based-machine-translation.md).

By the 2010s, the top systems, like Google Translate, used [*statistical* machine translation](statistical-machine-translation.md).  By the 2020s, the top systems used [*neural machine* translation](neural-machine-translation.md).

Each paradigm shift made machine translation systems more accurate and also easier to build.  The result was more [language support](/languages/languages.md) and more production systems from more [companies](/industry/companies.md).
