Machine translation for **search engine optimization** \(**SEO**\) is the translation of [commerce and marketplace](/nav_bar/building-and-research/applications/commerce-and-marketplaces.md) website content into the languages in which users are searching.

Translations for search engine optimization is challenging for machine translation because the end goal is not just to convey the meaning, but to use the words that the users actually search for in the target language.

Short input, like keywords and tags, and non-sentence input, like lists of keywords, are also a challenge for machine translation.

Content can be purely machine-translated, [hybrid-translated](/nav_bar/building-and-research/applications/workflows/hybrid-translation.md) or human [post-edited](/nav_bar/building-and-research/applications/workflows/post-editing.md).
Search engines can penalize machine-generated content, including purely machine-translated content.
