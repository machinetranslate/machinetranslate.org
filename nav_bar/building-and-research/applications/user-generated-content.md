description: Machine translation for user-generated content
---

Machine translation for **user-generated content** \(**UGC**\) is used mainly for **gisting**.

## Goals

Platforms translate their content to increase key metrics, like user engagement and sales.
User-generated content is a good fit for machine translation because it is continuous and high-scale.

User-generated content is challenging for machine translation because it is open-domain and noisy.

## Content types

* [Posts and comments](/nav_bar/building-and-research/applications/social-networks.md)
* [Live chat](/nav_bar/building-and-research/applications/live-chat.md)
* [Product titles, descriptions and reviews](/nav_bar/building-and-research/applications/commerce-and-marketplaces.md)
* [In-game content](/nav_bar/building-and-research/applications/gaming.md)
