description: Machine translation supported by human post-editing or evaluation
---

**Human-in-the-loop** consists of using human feedback for additional [training](/building-and-research/training.md) of translation engines.
Human feedback can be obtained from different tasks:
- Humans correct post-edited machine translation – see [adaptive machine translation](/customisation/adaptive.md)
- Humans annotate errors in the machine translation output – see [human evaluation metrics](/quality/metrics/human-evaluation-metrics.md)

Other human-machine interactions are also considered human-in-the-loop:
- Humans improve source content for better translatability
- Humans label training data to classify various domains or quality levels
- Fallback option to human translation in case an automated solution is inadequate

## Goal

The goal of human-in-the-loop is improving the [quality](/quality/quality.md) of machine translation output in all aspects:
- Accuracy – eliminating factual errors and hallucinating
- Fluency – making the language sound more natural for native speakers
- Terminology and style – using appropriate terms and style in given context

## Tasks

1. **Pre-editing**
Before feeding text into the machine translation system, human editors may pre-edit the source text to ensure that it is clear, concise, and easy to translate.

2. **Machine translation**
The pre-edited text is then fed into a machine translation system, which generates an initial translation.

3. **Post-editing**
A human post-editor reviews the machine-generated translation and makes any necessary corrections to improve the quality of the final output.
Professional translators perform this task.

4. **Quality assessment**
Human quality assessors may evaluate the quality of the machine-generated translations and provide feedback to the machine translation system to help it improve over time. This task requires a checklist of error categories and weights.
