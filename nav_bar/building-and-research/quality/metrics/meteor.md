**METEOR** (**Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering**)  is a metric for automatic evaluation of machine translation that calculates the similarity between a machine translation output and a reference translation using [n-grams](/../concepts/n-gram.md).

> Meteor evaluates a translation by computing a score based on explicit word-to-word matches between the translation and a given reference translation.

Apart from exact word matching, METEOR adds matching for synonyms and simple morphological variants of a word.

METEOR takes into account both the precision and recall while evaluating a match.
