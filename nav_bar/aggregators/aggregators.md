Machine translation API **aggregators** provide access to multiple machine translation [APIs](/apis/apis.md).

They may effectively provide [integrations](/integrations/integrations.md) in translation management systems for APIs that the translation management system has not integrated directly.

Aggregators may also add a layer of additional features, like pre-processing or post-processing, or consolidated billing.

Aggregators may also promise some form of "smart routing" - choosing which API to use for a [language](/languages/languages.md), [locale](/applications/advanced-concepts/locale.md) and content type.
