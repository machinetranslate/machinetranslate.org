An **n-gram** is a short sequence of word types.
`n` is the number of words in the sequence, for example, a 2-gram has two word types.
N-grams have many applications in machine translation:

- [language models](/concepts/language-model.md), such as an [n-gram maximum likelihood estimate](/concepts/language-model.md#n-gram-maximum-likelihood-estimate)
- translation models for [statistical machine translation](/approaches/statistical-machine-translation.md)
- evaluation [metrics](/quality/metrics/metrics.md), such as [BLEU](/quality/metrics/bleu.md)
- [language identification](/customisation/language-identification.md)

## Example

[String](/concepts/string.md) in English: `"The car has two doors."`

[Tokens](/customisation/tokenisation.md): `"The", "car", "has", "two", "doors", "."`

Unigrams: `"The", "car", "has", "two", "doors", "."`

Bigrams: `("The", "car"), ("car", "has"), ("has", "two"), ("two", "doors"), ("doors", ".")`
