There is a growing set of machine translation APIs available and [integrated into translation management systems (TMS)](/integrations/integrations.md).

The most popular APIs are available as self-serve APIs and support more than 100 [languages](/languages/languages.md) and more than 10000 language pairs.
By 2022, there was a self-serve API that supported more than 300 languages.

Besides language and [locale](/applications/advanced-concepts/locale.md) support, the APIs also vary by [features](/features/features.md), like [customisation](/customisation/customisation.md), [privacy policies](/features/data-confidentiality.md) and whether or not they are self-service products.

Most of the underlying machine translation systems are now based on [neural machine translation](/approaches/neural-machine-translation.md).

Here the APIs are ordered by the number of languages and [locales](/applications/advanced-concepts/locale.md) that each support.
