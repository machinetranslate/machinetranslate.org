**Generative AI and the Future of Machine Translation** will take place online on 8 November 2023.
It is organised by [**AMTA**](/associations/amta.md).

> Generative AI and the Future of Machine Translation will focus on advances in cross-lingual technology and processes that leverage Large Language Models. Moving beyond the explosion of hype that began with the general availability of ChatGPT in November 2022, this event is intended as a forum for a thoughtful exchange of ideas informed by a year of successes and failures in applying Large Language Models to the challenges of cross-lingual communication and data processing.

[amtaweb.org/amta-2023-virtual-call-for-proposals/](https://amtaweb.org/amta-2023-virtual-call-for-proposals/)

Generative AI and the Future of Machine Translation will include a keynote talk, expert panel discussions, presentations, tutorials for both beginners and more experienced practitioners, and demonstrations from technology providers.
