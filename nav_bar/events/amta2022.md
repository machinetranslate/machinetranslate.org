- Other

> We invite original, substantial, and unpublished research in all aspects of machine translation (MT).

Submission requirements:

- Maximum 10-page paper (unlimited for reference pages)
- Follow the style guides ([PDF version](https://amtaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/amta2022.pdf), [LaTeX version](https://amtaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AMTA-2022-Template.zip), [MS Word version](https://amtaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/amta2022.docx)) and submit in PDF format
- Do not include author names and affiliations
- Represent new work that has not been previously published

> Authors submitting a similar paper to another conference or workshop must specify this at submission time; if the paper is accepted to multiple venues, the author must choose which one to present at.

- Papers must be submitted via the [Submission website](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/User/Login?ReturnUrl=%2FAMTA2022)

#### Users and providers

Chairs: Janice Campbell, Jay Marciano, Konstantin Savenkov, Alex Yanishevsky (mtusers-providers@amtaweb.org)

> We seek submissions for 15-20-minute presentations (including a few minutes for questions and discussion) concerning the use of MT and/or related tools, processes, and technologies to support business goals and serve the customer or user in commercial settings.

Topics:

- Domain adaptation and customisation of MT models: commercial customisation platforms, implementation of open frameworks, and comparison of methodologies used to adapt and customize baseline engines.
- Data preparation: data sources, extraction, alignment, and cleaning of corpora, terminology, data augmentation, metadata extraction, working with data drift.
- MT for low-resource languages: language pairs with limited data; cross-dialect and cross-domain translation.
- Comparison and evaluation of MT systems: with respect to business, technical and linguistic requirements.
- MT output quality and confidence scoring: tools, methods, and metrics, such as human evaluations, automatic scoring, and MTQE.
- Advanced MT fine-tuning and enhancement: including pre- and post-processing; controlling style, tone of voice, gender, pseudonymisation; automatic post-editing (APE).
- Interactive and real-time adaptive MT systems: including advanced approaches to leverage TM and end-user feedback.
- MT Post-Editing: New approaches to MTPE, success and failure stories, applicability to different content-types, MTPE training, defining fair pricing models and working with translation buyers and providers.
- Technical challenges to MT adoption: file format and tag support, integration, security, performance, data protection, profanity filters, locality, and compliance.
- Business Cases: making the business case for adopting MT to drive business requirements, expand markets and engage with customers. Post-edited MT, real-time MT, cross-language information retrieval.
- Augmenting MT with ML and NLP: classification, context awareness, content moderation, sentiment analysis, OCR, ASR, and TTS.
- Source text improvement: improving the source content destined for MT through automatic tools such as grammar correction, guidelines, and NLP.

Submission requirements:

- Workshop title
- 250-500 word workshop description
- Clarify whether this is an ongoing or new workshop
