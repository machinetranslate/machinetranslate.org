The first workshop on Corpus Generation and Corpus Augmentation for Machine Translation (**CoCo4MT**) was co-located with [AMTA 2022](amta2022.md#workshop-on-corpus-generation-and-corpus-augmentation-for-machine-translation) on 16 September 2022.

It was the first workshop centered around research focusing on corpora creation, cleansing, and augmentation techniques specifically for machine translation.

Topics (not limited):

- Difficulties with using existing corpora (e.g., political considerations or domain limitations) and their effects on final MT systems,
- Strategies for collecting new MT datasets (e.g., via crowdsourcing),
- Data augmentation techniques,
- Data cleansing and denoising techniques,
- Quality control strategies for MT data,
- Exploration of datasets for pretraining or auxiliary tasks for training MT systems.
