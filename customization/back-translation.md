# Back-translation

**Back-translation** or **reverse translation** is a quality assurance process that consists in translating a translated document back into the source language.

### Goals
The goal of back-translation is the **reconciliation**. In a reconciliation, the result of the back-translation and the original document are compared to detect errors, ambiguities, and discrepancies.

### Challenges
Back-translations can increase the costs of translation projects.

Back-translation is not a well-documented or transparent process. There are few objective methods of validating a back-translation.
