description: How to connect machine translation engines to computer-aided translation tools

> ___&ldquo;The biggest challenge is to combine technology and the human side without losing the latter&rdquo;___ — Gordana Antonijević  



Machine Translation technology allows users to automatically translate text from one language to another.
Both Trados and memoQ use plugins to connect to machine translation engine vendors.
This tutorial provides information as to how to obtain application programming interfaces (API) keys from machine translation vendors and enter them into the plugins.
