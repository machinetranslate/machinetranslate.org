Machine translation API **aggregators** provide access to multiple machine translation [APIs](/apis).

They may effectively provide [integrations](/integrations) in translation management systems for APIs that the translation management system has not integrated directly.

Aggregators may also add a layer of additional features, like pre-processing or post-processing, or consolidated billing.

Aggregators may also promise some form of "smart routing" - choosing which API to use for a [language](/languages), [locale](/locale) and content type.
