---

**Georges Artsrouni** was an engineer who filed and received the first patent for a mechanical translator.

Artsrouni was born and grew up in Tbilisi.  He studied in St. Petersburg.

In 1932, he created a device that he called a "mechanical brain".  In 1933, he filed and received a patent for it in France.

The mechanical translator was in the form of a paper tape. It was a general-purpose machine with many potential applications. The main application was a mechanical multilingual dictionary.

He then built a second version.  In 1937 it won the main prize for mechanography at an exhibition in Paris.

In the same years, [Petr Troyanskii](/people/petr-troyanskii.md) independently filed a patent in Moscow.

In the 1960s, the device was acquired by the Museum of Arts and Crafts in Paris.
