The **European Association for Machine Translation** (**EAMT**) is a non-profit association that serves people interested in machine translation and translation tools, including users, developers, and researchers.

The EAMT is one of three regional associations of the International Association for Machine Translation \([IAMT](/iamt)\).
Its sister associations are the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas \([AMTA](/amta)\) and the Asia-Pacific Association for Machine Translation \([AAMT](/aamt)\).
