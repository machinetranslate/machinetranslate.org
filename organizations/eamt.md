The **European Association for Machine Translation** (**EAMT**) is a non-profit organization that serves people interested in machine translation and translation tools, including users, developers, and researchers.

The EAMT is one of three regional associations of the International Association for Machine Translation \([IAMT](organizations/iamt.md)\). Its sister organizations are the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas \([AMTA](organizations/amta.md)\) and the Asia-Pacific Association for Machine Translation \([AAMT](organization/aamt.md)\). Members of any of the three regional associations automatically become part of the IAMT network.

The EAMT was established in 1991 in Switzerland.
