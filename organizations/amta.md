The **Association for Machine Translation in the Americas** (**AMTA**) is an association of researchers and users of machine translation technologies. Its purpose is to unite people interested in machine translation and to provide an opportunity for commercial machine translation developers, professional translators and research scientists to share ideas, experiences and priorities.

The AMTA is the North American component of three regional associations of the International Association for Machine Translation \([IAMT](organizations/iamt.md)\). Its sister organizations are the European Association for Machine Translation \([EATA](organizations/eata.md)\) and the Asia-Pacific Association for Machine Translation \([AAMT](organization/aamt.md)\). Members of any of the three regional associations automatically become part of the IAMT network.

The AMTA was established in 1991 in Washington.
