Machine translation API **routers** provide access to multiple machine translation [APIs](/translation-apis).

They may effectively provide [integrations](/integrations) in translation management systems for APIs that the translation management system has not integrated directly.

Routers may also add a layer of additional features, like pre-processing or post-processing, or consolidated billing.

Routers may also promise some form of "smart routing" - choosing which API to use for a [language](/languages), [locale](/locale) and content type.
