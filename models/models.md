**Large language models** (**LLMs**) are a type of generative AI (GenAI) trained on very large collections of text. They learn patterns and can generate text that is fluent and coherent.

LLMs are general-purpose. They can translate, summarize or answer questions when given instructions. These instructions are called *prompts*.

Unlike traditional machine translation, like [neural machine translation](/neural-machine-translation), they are not trained only for translation.

LLMs can use context because they pay attention to the sentences before and after the input to give more natural results.

LLMs can make mistakes or give inconsistent results and they require significant computing resources.
